Bank Loan Prediction
Project Overview
Bank Loan Prediction is a simple yet powerful web application designed to assist financial institutions in evaluating loan applications quickly and reliably. By entering just two key details—applicant income and the requested loan amount—the application predicts whether a loan is likely to be approved or rejected.

Built with Flask on the backend and HTML/CSS on the frontend, this project leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to deliver accurate, real-time predictions in a clean and user-friendly interface.

Key Features
Machine Learning–Based Predictions – Uses a pre-trained model to assess loan approvals.

Streamlined User Experience – Minimal input fields and an intuitive form layout.

Flask-Powered Backend – Handles data input, prediction logic, and model integration.

Instant Results – Provides immediate approval or rejection feedback to the user.

Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Flask framework)

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Model Handling: Joblib for model serialization and loading

Deployment: Fully compatible with any Flask-supporting hosting environment

How It Works
The user inputs the applicant’s income and the requested loan amount.

The backend processes the input and passes it to the trained machine learning model.

The model evaluates the data and predicts whether the loan will be approved or rejected.

The result is displayed instantly on the webpage.
